Bug Reporting:

i'm testing it on a macmini running monterey version 12.5
the test willl be ran in both in safari Version 15.6 (17613.3.9.1.5), and chrome version 105.0.5195.125 

The first two bot options are to be clicked on, and then subsequently "dueled."
First task: localhost:3000
click the draw button
then click button "add to due" with the correspondibgnn bot named brobot
then click button "add to due" with the correspondibgnn botSelf-Aware Garbage Android
then click the duel button

Expectations: Knowing what ive seen, i expect the bots to battle, but to not log the score correctly.
the other expectation i have is that bot duel will run properly, i guess that is a bit of a redundancy on my part.
